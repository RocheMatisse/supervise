Description

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for a Data Challenge project undertaken during my Master's program. The project addresses two distinct predictive modeling problems:

    Regression Problem: Estimating the quality rating of a wine based on its chemical characteristics. The goal is to predict a continuous outcome (wine quality rated from 0 to 10).
    Classification Problem: Identifying celestial object types based on their characteristics. The objective is to classify objects into predefined categories based on observational data.

An extensive initial data analysis was conducted to explore dependencies among variables, assess the importance of different predictors, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps. These analyses informed our strategies for feature engineering and model selection.

Models Used

    Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random forests, ensemble modelling.
    Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests.


Prerequisites

    Python 
    Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
